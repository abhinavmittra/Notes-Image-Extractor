#Extraction of Notes Images from Whatsapp Folder.

We all end up with a clutter of notes images at the end of each semester,I have trained a CNN model to automatically extract the images and thereby reducing the task of manually selecting all of them to delete.

#Requirements:

<> Numpy
<> Keras

Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

I've trained the model on about 1000 images and using Keras' data augmentation pipeline. Currently the model is 85% accurate on my dataset.
