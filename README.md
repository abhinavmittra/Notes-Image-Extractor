# Notes-Image-Extractor
A simple CNN model to extract notes images automatically from your smartphone's Whatsapp folder.

We all end up with a clutter of notes images at the end of each semester,I have trained a CNN model to automatically extract the images and thereby reducing the task of manually selecting all of them to delete.

#Requirements:

<> Numpy <> Keras

Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

I've trained the model on about 1000 images and using Keras' data augmentation pipeline. Currently the model is 85% accurate on my dataset.
